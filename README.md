# About

Güvenli Yuvam is a mobile application developed for the Google Solution Challenge, aimed at providing users with tools to assess earthquake risks for their buildings, access safety guides, and stay informed about earthquake-related news. The project utilizes Gemini AI and is built using Flutter.

# Features

**Building Risk Analysis**: Users can add their buildings and perform risk analysis for potential earthquakes based on factors such as the number of floors, location, and ground structure.

**AI-Powered Risk Analysis**: Gemini AI analyzes uploaded construction plans/photos of buildings, providing users with additional risk analysis based on visual data.

**Database Integration** : Analyzed building data is added to the database, enabling users to access and view the analysis of various buildings.

**Meeting Areas Locator**: Users can locate nearby meeting areas designated for emergencies during earthquakes.

**Earthquake Guides and News**: Access to earthquake-related guides and news from within the application.
